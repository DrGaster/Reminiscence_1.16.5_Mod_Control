Mods to Advocate for

Debate needed
    better_diving, I'm not sure, I would like for us to debate on if we want to add it
        It allows for deeper swimming and has equipment that makes underwater work not as painful
            ie: *trying to do anything near the bottom of the ocean*

    Bygone Nether, undecided, seems like a cool mod but it adds world gen, only to the nether though so if we are up for it we could reset the nether and have this mod take affect or we could try it without resetting the nether and see what happens
        I personally think that this will give more life to the nether

Need More description
    Brain hurt while trying to look for wiki, here, have TeamAbnormal's Discord Instead: zADvTSy
        berry_good,  **denied** , I would like more of a description of what it adds
        buzzier_bees,  **denied** , I would like more of a description on what this adds

Clarify
    
    FastSuite,  **denied** , newly  **added**  mods do this
        FastSuite and the Crafting+Furnace Without Replacement are diffent, and the page says if both are added, there will be more benefit, but if one needs to choose between them, then Fastsuite would be better
    
    ECE - Enhanced Celestial Enhancement: The Second Moon,  **denied** , this is an addon for the mod  Enhanced Celestials that is currently not on the server
        Enchanced Celestials - Blood, Blue, & Harvest (Super) Moons is installed on the server
    
    Dragonfightconfigendergetic,  **denied** , I don't believe that it is usfule and or needed on the server
        This is so that Dragon Fight Config can manipulate the Enderdragon by Endergetic Expansion
    
    Lazy DataFixerUpper(LazyDFU)  **denied** ?, im not exactly sure if this only for converting data to newer versions and if so it is  **denied**  as of now but will be considered in the future if there are any updates to the server version
        This mod is to delay the installation of the program that converts data to newer versions, and is safer than Vazkii's DataFixerSlayer, which prevents it from existing at all

    betterdrowning,  **denied** , if you wanted this for the Clearer Water feature, i think client side mods exist to do this
        Mainly wanted the realistic water preassure damage, but eh
    
    archersarsenal

Will Look into alternatives
    Miner Helmet,  **denied** , I kinda wish it would interact with the lucent mod but this simply gives night vision to the wearer. If you can find a mod that does this I will hapily add it to the server
        Perhaps you looked at the wrong one? If I remember, it was this that directed me to Lucent
        https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/miners-helmet
    Better Level,  **denied** , I would like a fix for the experience system in minecraft being "mean" but i dont believe this is the way but as always this can be debated
        Not exactly the same thing, but should powerscaling ever become a issue of not enough, well...
            https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-leveling

plausible
    bettergamemenu, as of now, no but I do see this being  **added**  in the future
        Ight, but also, as you should have seen, this is the fusion of two mods

    Champions,  **denied** , could be cool but mobs are rather difficult but I could do some config and hopfully make life not a living hell, I would like for us to debate if we want this on the server
        Main Reason for this suggestion is to have variability between mobs, so that not all mobs are the same difficulty just because of distance from spawn

    arsenal_integration, debating as it only integrates with one mod that we have on the server, mythical botany
        Also Integrates with Normal Botania, Mythic Botania area the Alfsteel counterparts
    
    Tetra Toolbooster,  **denied** , I feel as though the mods currently on the server that offer armor and tools are suffiecent but we can debate on this
        I can understand this, but I think this should be put on the back burner, for later consideration, although, the items that it adds require end game things


Mentions needing world trimming
    Autumnity, I want to add this but it adds in world geneartion but again with some world trimming it should be possible to add, I will leave this up to debates if we want this
    Upgrade Aquatic, im not sure, I would like to add this but it adds world generation but I can do some world trimming to hopfully make this work
    Neapolitan, unsure, It seems like a cool food mod but it adds in world gen which may cause some issues but probably not, I could also do some world trimming to hopfully make it so some of the items are actually obtainable or add in custom npcs at spawn that sell the items, I would like to debate on this
In regards of world trimming, mainly depends on how far bases are from spawn and method used to trim or prune the world chunks

Was not added only on basis of mod count
    betterburning,  **denied** , I would generally like to keep the mod count low and it doesnt seem like this mod adds much but we can debate on if we want this mod or not
    Everything is edible, even you!,  **denied** , I dont really have a reason for this one other then I want to keep the server mod count low which is a shitty reason so if you want this  **added**  please tell me
        Yes, Canabilism.


Was not on the list of added nor denied

    The Origin's Collection? Probably a bad idea- a cool one, but a bad one nonetheless
        but oh well, might as well mention it...





No clear opinion for response
    [SBM] Cardboard Boxes,  **denied** , Instead we will have the carry on mod
    YDM's Vulture,  **denied** , It just kinda feels weird to add and out of the blue but we can debate if we want this
    Vampires Need Umbrellas,  **denied** , I feel as though this kinda defeats the purpose of sun being a weakness to vampires but we can debate on this
    Get It Together, Drops!,i see this being problematic for farms but also being beneficial to them so we will debate on this
    Just Enough Piglin Bartering,  **denied** , sorry but it requires the Babel mod which has been  **denied**  but we can debate on this
    Babel,  **denied** , many of the comments on the mod complain about it causing crashes or not working and there hasn't been an update for it since those comments

Agreed
    dynamiclights,  **denied** , Lucent does this
    Just Enough Breeding (JEBr),  **denied** , i feel like what mobs need to breed is common knowledge but if you deagree we can debate, also this is a client side mod so it can be  **added**  to your client
        I just looked at the integrations and didn't see anything that was on the server
    Vampirism.co Quirks,  **denied** , little to no doccumentation, if someone wants too they can send me a description of what this does and I will reconsider
        reading it closer, looks like this is either intended for the modpack by the same name, or is a few things from the modpack that were itneresting enough
